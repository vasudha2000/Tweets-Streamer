# Tweets-Streamer
This project will help to stream tweets from tweepy package and store them in a json file.

I have made this project in a python virtual environment.
Please refer to the docs [here] for setting up your virtual environment.

The [requirements.txt] file will be used for installing all the packages and their dependencies.

Run the [twitter_streamer.py] file to stream tweets and store them in tweets.json file.

The [tweets.json] is stored in the folder stream_tweets

The [twitter_credentials_github.py] file is used to store the credentials from your twitter developer account.
