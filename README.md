# Tweets-Streamer
This project will help to stream tweets from tweepy package and store them in a json file.

I have made this project in a python virtual environment.
Please refer to the docs <https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/creating-python-virtual-environment-windows-linux/> for setting up your virtual environment.

The <requirements.txt> file will be used for installing all the packages and their dependencies.

Run the <twitter_streamer.py> file to stream tweets and store them in tweets.json file.

The <tweets.json> is stored in the folder stream_tweets

The <twitter_credentials_github.py> file is used to store the credentials from your twitter developer account.
