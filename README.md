# Tweets-Streamer
This project will help to stream tweets from tweepy package and store them in a json file.

I have made this project in a python virtual environment.
Please refer to the docs <https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/creating-python-virtual-environment-windows-linux/> for setting up your virtual environment
